#  Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transaction patterns to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, addressing real-world challenges such as data imbalance and financial risk mitigation.

---

##  Project Goals
- Build effective machine learning models for fraud detection  
- Compare the performance of multiple classification algorithms  
- Handle highly imbalanced transaction data  
- Gain practical exposure to real-world financial anomaly detection  

---

##  Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook for clarity and comparison.

##  Dataset Description
- Contains numerical credit card transaction records  
- Features are transformed for privacy protection  
- Target variable:
  - `0` → Legitimate transaction  
  - `1` → Fraudulent transaction  
- Dataset is highly imbalanced, making accurate fraud detection challenging
